# Crop-and-Weed-Detection
This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Crop and Weed Detection" project, aiming to develop an efficient system that accurately detects and differentiates crops from weeds in agricultural fields.
## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to provide farmers with a reliable tool to enhance their crop management practices and improve agricultural productivity through automated crop and weed detection using computer vision and machine learning techniques.
## Weekly Progress Report
### Week 1: Project Initiation and Problem Exploration
During the first week, the project team conducted an in-depth literature review on crop and weed detection. The team identified key challenges and potential solutions and defined the project's scope and objectives.
### Week 2: Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing
In the second week, significant progress was made in acquiring a diverse dataset of agricultural images. Data preprocessing techniques, such as image resizing, data augmentation, and normalization, were applied to enhance the data quality for model development and training.
